## Description

This project analyzes sales and review data for video games to predict whether a title will be a hit.  
- First, we clean and explore the data (sales, genre, scores).  
- Then we create new useful features (feature engineering).  
- Next, we build visualizations to understand trends.  
- Finally, we train classification models in Python (scikit-learn) and evaluate their accuracy to recommend marketing strategies.
